# Casino_guessing_game
 This is a Casino Game project in C++ language. It is a simple game where the user places a bet on a number between 1 and 10, and the computer generates a random number between 1 and 10. If the user's number matches the generated number, the user wins and gets 10 times their betting amount. Otherwise, the user loses their betting amount.  The program consists of two classes: Display and PlayerInfo.  The Display class has functions for displaying various messages and drawing lines. The PlayerInfo class has functions for getting and setting the amount, guessing number, and betting amount, updating the amount based on win/lose, and checking if the player wins or not.  The main function creates an object of the PlayerInfo class and calls its functions to play the game. The game continues until the player decides to quit or runs out of money.
